## Overview

VVTerm is a cross-platform SSH terminal app for Apple platforms. The current codebase targets iOS and macOS, uses Ghostty for terminal rendering, libssh2/OpenSSL for SSH transport, CloudKit for sync, and Keychain for local credential storage.

## Current State

- Main app target: `VVTerm`
- Companion target: `VVTermLiveActivity`
- Runtime targets: `macOS 13.3+` and `iOS 16.1+`
- Hardware targets: Apple Silicon / arm64 only
- App-owned code is organized under `VVTerm/App`, `VVTerm/Core`, and `VVTerm/Features`
- The repo also contains tests, native vendor builds, feature specs under `docs/specs`, and the marketing site under `web/`

## Implemented Feature Areas

### Terminal and connections

- GPU-accelerated terminal rendering via `GhosttyKit`
- SSH authentication with password, SSH key, and SSH key + passphrase
- Connection modes for standard SSH and Mosh
- Multi-session connection management with tabs, split panes, reconnect handling, and persisted session state
- tmux-aware startup, attach, install, and recovery flows
- Rich paste and clipboard helpers for terminal input
- iOS keyboard accessory support, including special keys and custom actions
- iOS Live Activity status for active terminal connections

### Servers and organization

- Workspaces with ordering, colors, and environment grouping
- Server metadata including favorites, tags, notes, last-connected timestamps, and biometric-unlock requirements
- Pro limit enforcement for workspaces, servers, tabs, and split panes
- Local-network SSH discovery via Bonjour and subnet probing

### Remote files

- SFTP-backed remote file browser for iOS and macOS
- Directory browsing with breadcrumbs, sorting, hidden-file toggles, and persisted browser state
- File preview, upload, download, export/share, new folder, rename, move, and delete flows
- Permission editing and remote-file conflict resolution

### Security and sync

- Keychain-backed storage for SSH credentials
- CloudKit sync for servers, workspaces, terminal theme preferences, and terminal accessory profile data
- Full-app lock and per-server biometric unlock
- Privacy-mode support

### Customization and productivity

- Built-in and custom terminal themes with validation, storage-path management, and sync-aware preference handling
- Customizable terminal accessory bar with reorderable actions and user-defined shortcuts
- Terminal presets for saved commands/snippets
- Settings surfaces for general, terminal, sync, keychain, pro, and about flows
- Welcome/onboarding and in-app support surfaces

### Stats and voice input

- Remote server stats collection with live CPU and memory history
- On-device voice-to-command pipeline with MLX model management and Apple Speech fallback

## Architecture

VVTerm uses a feature-first structure for app-owned code.

Feature modules follow these boundaries:

- `Domain`: pure types and rules
- `Application`: state, orchestration, coordinators, managers
- `Infrastructure`: persistence, transport, adapters, external integrations
- `UI`: SwiftUI/AppKit/UIKit presentation

## Requirements

- Apple Silicon Mac for development
- Xcode `16.0+`
- macOS `13.3+`
- iOS `16.1+`
- `zig` and `cmake`

Install the non-Xcode build tools with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install zig cmake
```

## Building From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vivy-company/vvterm.git
cd vvterm

# Build native vendor libraries (GhosttyKit + libssh2/OpenSSL)
./scripts/build.sh all

# Open the project in Xcode
open VVTerm.xcodeproj
```

`./scripts/build.sh` supports `all`, `ghostty`, `ssh`, `clean`, and `help`.
