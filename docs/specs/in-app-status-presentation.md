# In-App Status and Notification Presentation (Draft Spec)

Draft date: 2026-04-07

## Summary
Refactor VVTerm's in-app status and notification presentation into a small shared system with:
- a consistent taxonomy
- shared visual primitives
- explicit ownership boundaries
- predictable placement rules

This is primarily a structural and presentation-architecture refactor.

The goal is not to add more toast types. The goal is to reduce ad hoc overlays and make status presentation stable as the app grows.

## Problem
VVTerm currently has multiple overlapping ways to communicate status:
- large center cards
- compact top banners
- bottom transfer cards
- local one-off error overlays
- native alerts for some cases

These patterns were added incrementally inside feature views. As a result:
- similar states are shown differently in different places
- placement is chosen locally instead of by product-wide rules
- terminal and split-terminal implementations duplicate the same presentation logic
- feature code mixes status semantics with view layout
- there is no shared replacement/coalescing policy
- there is no obvious place to add future statuses like sync state, background transfers, or workspace-level errors

This makes the UI feel inconsistent and makes the code harder to scale safely.

## Current State

### Existing presentation surfaces
- App-shell initial connect empty state on iOS:
  - `VVTerm/App/iOS/iOSContentView.swift`
  - `connectingStateView(serverName:)`
- Terminal blocking and progress overlays:
  - `VVTerm/Features/TerminalSessions/UI/Terminal/TerminalContainerView.swift`
  - `stateOverlayLayer`
  - `progressOverlayLayer`
  - `topBannerOverlayLayer`
  - `errorOverlayLayer`
- Split-terminal duplicate status stack:
  - `VVTerm/Features/TerminalSessions/UI/Splits/TerminalView.swift`
- Terminal-specific banner and progress components:
  - `VVTerm/Features/TerminalSessions/UI/Terminal/TerminalStatusCard.swift`
  - `VVTerm/Features/TerminalSessions/UI/Terminal/TerminalRichPasteSupport.swift`
  - `TerminalTopBannerView`
  - `TerminalRichPasteProgressOverlay`
  - `TerminalRichPasteBannerOverlay`
- Files transfer overlay:
  - `VVTerm/Features/RemoteFiles/UI/RemoteFileBrowserScreen.swift`
  - `TransferStatus`
  - `performTransfer(...)`
  - `RemoteFileTransferStatusView`
- Offline banner utility:
  - `VVTerm/Core/UI/OfflineBanner.swift`
  - currently not integrated into app root presentation

### Current inconsistency examples
- Reconnecting is shown as a large center card in some terminal paths and as a compact top banner in others.
- Rich paste owns a private banner/progress system instead of using a shared terminal or app-level presenter.
- Files uploads/downloads use a custom bottom overlay unrelated to terminal progress UI.
- Terminal errors can appear in a lightweight bottom overlay while connection failures use a center card.
- Offline infrastructure exists, but there is no common host for app-wide persistent status.

### Root cause
The current issue is not only visual inconsistency. It is ownership inconsistency.

Today, leaf views decide all of the following at once:
- what the status means
- whether it blocks interaction
- where it appears
- how long it lives
- how it is styled

That coupling does not scale.

## Goals
- Define a small, explicit taxonomy for in-app status presentation.
- Use one stable placement rule per status category.
- Separate screen-blocking state from non-blocking notices.
- Consolidate duplicated terminal and files presentation code.
- Keep shared primitives in `Core` and keep feature-specific policy in features.
- Preserve current flows unless a behavior change is required for consistency or correctness.
- Make status presentation testable without rendering whole screens.

## Non-Goals
- Replacing system notifications outside the app.
- Replacing native `alert` and `confirmationDialog` with custom UI.
- Redesigning terminal, files, or server list layouts.
- Introducing a generic queue of arbitrary toasts for every feature.
- Solving background transfer architecture in this spec.

## Platform Guidance
Apple does not provide a single generic "toast" pattern for all in-app messaging.

The relevant platform guidance is:
- alerts are for important, interruptive, actionable situations
- modality should be used sparingly
- progress should be shown consistently and be determinate when possible
- loading should prefer inline or context-aware presentation over unnecessary interruption

Relevant HIG pages:
- `https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/alerts`
- `https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/modality`
- `https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/progress-indicators`
- `https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/loading`

Product interpretation for VVTerm:
- not every status should become a toast
- routine success should usually not interrupt
- persistent degraded state belongs in a stable inline/banner region
- user-initiated operation progress belongs near the bottom edge of the active surface
- full-screen or center-card blocking UI should be reserved for states where the screen cannot meaningfully operate

## Proposed Taxonomy

### 1. Blocking Screen State
Use when the primary surface cannot currently function.

Examples:
- initial connection before a terminal exists
- disconnected terminal with primary recovery action
- terminal startup failure
- fatal file browser load state where content cannot be shown

Presentation:
- compact-detent native bottom sheet on iOS/iPadOS for initial connection and actionable recovery states
- center card or full empty-state presentation on macOS
- may disable underlying interaction
- may include primary action like `Retry`

Rules:
- this is not a toast
- this remains screen-owned state
- use a shared blocking-state component, not a global notification center
- dismiss it before presenting a follow-up flow such as tmux session selection
- automatic reconnect never uses this surface
- on iOS/iPadOS, only the selected tab's focused pane may own the native connection sheet
- initial-versus-reconnect presentation follows pane session history, not SwiftUI view lifetime

### 2. Persistent Top Banner
Use for non-blocking ongoing status or degraded mode.

Examples:
- reconnecting after the terminal has already been established
- SSH fallback for a Mosh session
- offline app-wide state
- sync paused or degraded cloud state

Presentation:
- top safe-area inset
- compact height
- non-modal
- optional dismiss action only when the state is informational rather than essential

Rules:
- one banner lane per host
- reconnecting should always use this lane once content already exists
- the transient disconnected state immediately preceding automatic reconnect also uses this lane and never presents a reconnect action sheet
- banner content should be concise and action-light

### 3. Bottom Operation Notice
Use for user-initiated work in progress and near-term completion/error for that same work.

Examples:
- upload
- download
- transfer
- install tmux
- install mosh-server
- rich paste upload or preparation

Presentation:
- bottom safe-area inset
- compact card
- determinate progress when available
- optional completion state in the same card

Rules:
- one operation lane per host
- the same lane shows start, progress, completion, and operation-level failure
- success should usually auto-dismiss
- routine completion should not also generate a second banner

### 4. Native Alert / Confirmation Dialog
Use only for decisions, destructive actions, permissions, or important interruptions.

Examples:
- delete confirmation
- install prompt
- permission denial explanation with immediate acknowledgement

Rules:
- do not use alerts for routine connectivity or progress status
- do not use alerts for "success"

### 5. Inline Validation / Field Feedback
Use inside the local form or control.

Examples:
- invalid folder name
- rename validation
- theme import validation

Rules:
- keep local to the form
- do not route through shared notice infrastructure

## Mapping Current VVTerm States

| Current state | Target category | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Initial connect before terminal exists | Blocking Screen State | Compact-detent native sheet on iOS/iPadOS |
| Reconnecting after terminal already existed | Persistent Top Banner | Remove center reconnect card in this case |
| SSH fallback / degraded transport | Persistent Top Banner | Same lane as reconnect status |
| Rich paste progress | Bottom Operation Notice | Merge into shared operation lane |
| File upload/download progress | Bottom Operation Notice | Replace custom Files-only presenter with shared primitive |
| Install tmux / install mosh | Bottom Operation Notice | Same operation lane as other long-running tasks |
| Disconnected with retry | Blocking Screen State | Compact-detent native sheet on iOS/iPadOS; centered card on macOS |
| Connection failed | Blocking Screen State | Compact-detent native sheet on iOS/iPadOS; centered card on macOS |
| Offline app state | Persistent Top Banner | App/root host |
| Operation-specific failure after action started | Bottom Operation Notice | With optional retry/action when meaningful |
| Delete / install prompts | Native Alert / Confirmation Dialog | Keep native |

Concurrent bottom operations render as an ordered notification stack. Updating one operation preserves its position and does not replace or dismiss other active transfers. Closing an active upload or transfer requires native cancellation confirmation before its task is cancelled.
The stack keeps visible separation between cards and shows an active-operation count whenever more than one operation is present.

## Architectural Direction

### Core principle
Separate status semantics from status rendering.

Feature/application code should declare:
- scope
- category
- content
- lifetime
- progress
- actions

Shared UI infrastructure should decide:
- visual component
- placement
- transition
- spacing
- replacement behavior within a lane

### Shared vs local ownership
Not all status should go through one global bus.

The recommended split is:
- blocking screen states remain local to the owning feature/screen
- non-blocking top and bottom notices use shared models and shared hosts

This preserves clarity:
- terminal connectivity state still belongs to terminal/session features
- file transfer state still belongs to Files
- app-wide offline state belongs to app/root
- visuals and placement are still unified

## Proposed Structure

```text
VVTerm/
├── Core/
│   └── UI/
│       └── Notices/
│           ├── NoticeModels.swift
│           ├── NoticeHost.swift
│           ├── NoticeBannerView.swift

    │   └── ...
    └── RemoteFiles/
        └── ...
```

### Shared core models
Proposed model shape:

```swift
enum NoticeLane {
    case topBanner
    case bottomOperation
}

enum NoticeLevel {
    case info
    case success
    case warning
    case error
}

enum NoticeLifetime {
    case persistent
    case autoDismiss(Duration)
}

struct NoticeProgress: Equatable {
    var completedUnitCount: Int?
    var totalUnitCount: Int?
}

struct NoticeAction: Identifiable {
    let id: String
    let title: LocalizedStringKey
    let role: ButtonRole?
    let handler: @MainActor @Sendable () -> Void
}

struct NoticeItem: Identifiable {
    let id: String
    let lane: NoticeLane
    let level: NoticeLevel
    let title: String?
    let message: String
    let progress: NoticeProgress?
    let lifetime: NoticeLifetime
    let action: NoticeAction?
    let dismissAction: (() -> Void)?
}
```

### Shared host and host model
`NoticeHost` is the shared renderer for top and bottom lanes.

It should support two driving modes:
- direct state-driven input from the owning screen
- lightweight imperative updates through a scoped host model

This split is intentional.

State-driven screens:
- terminal reconnect and fallback status are derived from connection state
- app-level offline state is derived from `NetworkMonitor`

Imperative flows:
- file transfer progress updates over time
- future background-like operation flows that need explicit replacement by id

Use a lightweight host model per presentation scope, not one singleton queue for the whole app.

```swift
struct NoticeHost<Content: View>: View {
    let topBanner: NoticeItem?
    let bottomOperation: NoticeItem?
    let content: Content
}
```

Optional scoped model:

```swift
@MainActor
@Observable
final class NoticeHostModel {
    var topBanner: NoticeItem?
    var bottomOperation: NoticeItem?

    func show(_ item: NoticeItem)
    func dismiss(id: String)
    func update(id: String, progress: NoticeProgress?, message: String)
}
```

Rules:
- one visible item per lane per host
- updates replace by `id`
- equivalent repeated banners may be coalesced
- operation notices update in place rather than stacking
- features should not be forced through `NoticeHostModel` when the notice is already a pure function of screen state

## Shared View Primitives

### `BlockingStatusView`
Purpose:
- reusable center-card or empty-state style for blocking states

Source material today:
- `TerminalStatusCard`
- iOS `connectingStateView`

Notes:
- this should absorb the useful parts of `TerminalStatusCard`
- name should reflect that it is not terminal-specific

### `NoticeBannerView`
Purpose:
- compact top banner with optional icon, spinner, and dismiss action

Source material today:
- `TerminalTopBannerView`
- `OfflineBanner` visual direction

### `OperationNoticeView`
Purpose:
- bottom card for progress, completion, and operation-scoped failure

Source material today:
- `RemoteFileTransferStatusView`
- `TerminalRichPasteProgressOverlay`
- tmux/mosh install overlays

## Visual Direction

The system should look like one family of surfaces with three sizes, not three unrelated components.

### Shared styling principles
- use one corner radius family and one border treatment across banners and cards
- use semantic tint only for the icon/spinner/accent, not for all text
- prefer mostly opaque terminal-aware surfaces over glass when drawn above terminal content
- prefer system background or material styling on non-terminal surfaces
- keep copy short and action count low

### Top banner
- compact, stable strip inset from the top safe area
- roughly 36 to 44pt tall on iPhone, slightly roomier on macOS
- leading spinner or icon, one concise line of copy, optional lightweight action or dismiss button
- should feel persistent and quiet, not celebratory

### Bottom operation notice
- compact rounded card above the bottom safe area
- supports title, short message, optional detail, progress, and one action
- should update in place across start, progress, completion, and operation failure
- success should briefly settle in the same card, then dismiss

### Blocking status card
- centered lightweight status card, not a sheet
- used only when the screen cannot yet function
- title, short explanation, spinner or icon, optional primary action
- wider on macOS, but visually the same family as iOS

### Platform differences
- iOS should use tighter spacing and safe-area-first placement
- macOS can use slightly wider cards and more breathing room against window chrome
- terminal surfaces on both platforms must avoid translucent glass directly over terminal content
- the system should be recognizably the same on both platforms without being pixel-identical

## Presentation Hosts

### App host
Attach near app root:
- iOS root around `iOSContentView`
- macOS root around `ContentView`

Use for:
- offline
- sync paused/degraded
- future app-wide account/store/sync notices

### Terminal host
Attach inside:
- `TerminalContainerView`
- `TerminalView`

Use for:
- reconnecting banner
- fallback banner
- operation notices for tmux/mosh install and rich paste

Implementation note:
- terminal hosts should usually be driven directly by computed `NoticeItem?` values
- only use a host model here if a terminal flow becomes imperative enough to need it later

### Files host
Attach inside:
- `RemoteFileBrowserScreen`

Use for:
- upload/download/transfer progress
- transfer completion
- transfer failure

Implementation note:
- Files is the primary example of a scoped `NoticeHostModel` because transfers update by id over time

## Feature Integration Rules

### TerminalSessions
- keep `disconnected` and `failed` as blocking states
- keep initial terminal boot as blocking state
- treat reconnect after first successful connection as a top banner only
- move rich paste banner/progress into the shared notice host
- remove terminal-specific duplicate top/bottom presenter types after migration

### RemoteFiles
- replace `TransferStatus` screen-local presenter with shared bottom operation notice primitives
- keep destructive decisions in native alerts/sheets
- keep create/rename/move form validation local to forms

### App / Network / Sync
- replace standalone offline banner utility with app-host banner integration
- app-wide network and sync states must not compete with screen-local operation notices
- app-level notices should live only in the app host's top lane

## Behavior Rules

### Reconnect behavior
- Before terminal exists:
  - blocking center state allowed
- After terminal exists:
  - reconnect uses top banner
  - no center reconnect card

### Success behavior
- Default: do not show a generic success toast if the UI already makes the outcome clear
- Operation lane may briefly show completion if:
  - the result is not obvious from surrounding content
  - there is a useful follow-up action

Examples:
- file download export ready: allowed in bottom operation lane
- upload complete while file list visibly refreshed: brief completion allowed, separate top banner not needed
- reconnect success: no success toast

### Error behavior
- Blocking failures:
  - center state with action
- Non-blocking operation failures:
  - bottom operation lane
- Destructive confirmations or permission decisions:
  - native alert/dialog

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Extract shared primitives
- Create `Core/UI/Notices/`.
- Move or adapt:
  - `TerminalStatusCard` -> `BlockingStatusView`
  - `TerminalTopBannerView` -> `NoticeBannerView`
  - shared visual pieces from `RemoteFileTransferStatusView` -> `OperationNoticeView`
- Do not change feature behavior yet.

### Phase 2: Introduce `NoticeHostModel` and `NoticeHost`
- Add `NoticeHost` as the shared top/bottom lane renderer using `safeAreaInset`.
- Add a simple optional host model with:
  - `topBanner`
  - `bottomOperation`
- Add preview fixtures for each lane.

### Phase 3: Migrate terminal container
- Replace `topBannerOverlayLayer` and `progressOverlayLayer` with shared notice host lanes.
- Keep blocking states local.
- Convert reconnect, fallback, tmux install, mosh install, and rich paste progress/banner into typed notices.

### Phase 4: Migrate split terminal
- Remove duplicated overlay implementation from `TerminalView`.
- Reuse the same terminal notice primitives and policies as `TerminalContainerView`.

### Phase 5: Migrate Files
- Replace `TransferStatus` and `RemoteFileTransferStatusView` plumbing with shared bottom operation notices.
- Preserve current transfer logic and timing behavior.

### Phase 6: Add app/root host
- Integrate offline and future sync notices at the app/root level.
- Retire `OfflineBanner.swift` or reduce it to a style helper if useful.

### Phase 7: Cleanup
- Remove terminal-specific presenter duplication.
- Remove dead banner/progress types that are superseded by shared primitives.
- Add documentation comments describing lane rules.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit tests
- mapping tests for connection state -> blocking state vs banner
- operation notice update/coalescing tests
- auto-dismiss behavior tests
- replacement-by-id tests

### UI tests
- reconnect after established session shows top banner, not center card
- upload/download progress appears in bottom lane
- connection failure still shows blocking retry state

### Preview coverage
- banner info/warning/error
- operation progress, success, and failure
- blocking connecting/disconnected/failed states

## Risks
- Over-centralizing true screen state into a generic notice bus
- Breaking safe-area behavior around terminal chrome, navigation bars, and keyboard accessories
- Losing contextual actions during migration if notice actions are over-simplified
- Treating multiple concurrent operations as one lane when feature requirements actually need a queue later

## Open Questions
- Should the operation lane stay single-item in V1, or should Files reserve the option for a future transfer queue UI?
- Should app-wide offline always be shown, or only when the current feature requires network?
- Should operation failure always remain in the bottom lane, or should some failures escalate to blocking state when the owning screen cannot recover?

## Recommended First Cut
The first implementation cut should be:
- shared top banner
- shared bottom operation notice
- shared blocking status card
- terminal reconnect policy cleanup

That gets the biggest consistency win quickly without introducing a heavyweight global notification system.
