## Architecture Direction

VVTerm uses a **feature-first architecture** for app-owned source code.

Current architecture:
- `App` owns app entry, composition roots, shared root containers, localization preferences, and iOS app-shell navigation.
- `Core/Sync` owns CloudKit sync infrastructure.
- `Core/Security` owns keychain, device identity, and privacy-mode infrastructure.
- `Core/Network` owns shared connectivity monitoring.
- `Core/UI` owns shared view primitives and presentation helpers reused across features.
- `Core/Terminal` owns shared clipboard, paste, and terminal text/default helpers.
- `Core/Logging` owns shared logging utilities.
- `Core/SSH` owns shared SSH bootstrap, known-hosts, key generation, environment detection, rich-paste support, tmux/mosh runtime helpers, and `SSHClient`.
- `Features/ConnectionViews` owns connection view tab configuration types and state.
- `Features/RemoteFiles` owns remote file browsing, preview, transfer, and SFTP integration.
- `Features/LocalDiscovery` owns discovery-specific code and UI.
- `Features/Servers` owns server/workspace domain models, server management, and server/workspace UI flows.
- `Features/Stats` owns server metrics collection and presentation.
- `Features/Security` owns app lock and biometric authentication flows.
- `Features/Settings` owns settings window presentation and settings screens.
- `Features/Store` owns Pro entitlements, purchases, and upgrade surfaces.
- `Features/Support` owns support/contact UI surfaces.
- `Features/TerminalThemes` owns theme models, validation, storage paths, parsing, and theme management.
- `Features/TerminalAccessories` owns keyboard accessory models, preferences, settings UI, and accessory validation flows.
- `Features/TerminalPresets` owns terminal preset models, persistence, and preset form UI.
- `Features/TerminalSessions` owns terminal session/tab domain models, session/tab managers, tmux prompt coordination, live activity support, and terminal session UI.
- `Features/VoiceInput` owns transcription/audio capture infrastructure, Doubao ASR integration, and transcription settings UI.
- `Features/Welcome` owns welcome/onboarding copy and presentation.
- New app code should land in `Features`, `Core`, or `App` based on ownership.
- New work inside a feature should stay inside its `Features/<FeatureName>` subtree and should not reintroduce app-wide bucket folders.

Feature-first shape:
- `Domain`: pure feature types and rules
- `Application`: feature state, orchestration, coordinators, use-case style logic
- `Infrastructure`: transport, persistence, adapters, external integrations
- `UI`: SwiftUI/AppKit/UIKit presentation only

For Files/SFTP specifically:
- no non-view logic under `UI`
- no feature policy inside `SSHClient` beyond low-level transport/session behavior
- use explicit dependency injection at the feature boundary
- do direct cutovers, not compatibility shims

For every feature:
- keep `Domain`, `Application`, `Infrastructure`, and `UI` boundaries intact
- prefer view-owned dependencies to be injected from the app/screen boundary instead of created inside leaf views
- if shared cross-feature primitives are needed, extract them into `Core` instead of creating new app-wide bucket folders

Apple platform UI split pattern:
- Follow `docs/specs/apple-platform-ui-split-pattern.md` for iOS/macOS UI ownership and migration details.
- Do not let shared SwiftUI files accumulate large inline `#if os(iOS)` / `#if os(macOS)` branches. If platform layout, lifecycle, modifiers, or state diverge, keep the shared feature shell neutral and move platform presentation into `Type+iOS.swift` and `Type+macOS.swift` files with file-level compile gates.
- Because VVTerm uses one multiplatform target, platform-specific files must still be guarded with `#if os(...)` unless target membership is explicitly changed; folder names such as `iOS/` or `macOS/` are not enough.
- Avoid `iOS`, `Mac`, `macOS`, and `MacOS` prefixes in product UI type names. Prefer feature/domain names and put platform ownership in the filename or folder.
- Platform prefixes are acceptable for true platform adapters and app-shell bridges, such as `NSViewRepresentable`, `UIViewRepresentable`, AppKit/UIKit delegates, toolbar/window/menu bridges, and Ghostty platform terminal views.
- Platform-specific stored SwiftUI state should usually live in platform child views or small platform models. Swift extensions cannot add stored properties, so do not keep long-term gated `@State` in shared views just to make an extension split compile.
- After platform UI splits, validate both iOS and macOS builds unless the change is documentation-only.

Stats UI ownership:
- Keep `ServerStatsView.swift` as a thin root wrapper for injected inputs, app/storage state, sheet triggers, and composition. Do not add metric cards, charts, detail sheets, or collector operations back into this file.
- Keep collection lifecycle, visibility handling, retry overlay, and collector action closures in `ServerStatsDashboard.swift`.
- Keep block ordering, style selection, preview composition, and page layout in `StatsBlocksContent.swift`, `StatsDashboardCards.swift`, and `ClassicStatsContent.swift`.
- Keep reusable cards, charts, gauges, and meters under `Features/Stats/UI/Components`, and detail sheets/rows under `Features/Stats/UI/Details`.
- Keep platform sheet chrome and close/search presentation behind `DetailPresentation.swift`, `DetailPresentation+iOS.swift`, and `DetailPresentation+macOS.swift`. Product UI types inside those files should use neutral names such as `StatsDetailShell` or `StatsSearchField`; the filename carries the platform ownership.
- Small inline platform gates are acceptable only for platform constants or narrow modifiers such as native colors, toolbar placement, or iOS detents. If a platform branch grows into a body/layout/lifecycle variant, split it into a platform file.

## Refactoring Rules

When doing architectural refactors:
- prioritize structural splits and ownership cleanup over behavior changes
- preserve existing UI, UX, and visual behavior unless the user explicitly asks for a change
- do not bundle redesigns or new features into a refactor
- keep platform parity intact unless a platform-specific bug is being fixed
- if a behavior change is necessary for correctness or safety, keep it minimal and isolated

Safe refactor expectation:
- same screens
- same entry points
- same interactions
- same user-facing flows
- smaller files, clearer boundaries, better ownership

## Testing and Regression Policy

- Every bug fix and regression fix must include automated test coverage unless it is genuinely not automatable. If coverage is not added, explain the blocker and the manual validation that was used.
- For regressions, write or update a deterministic failing test first when feasible, then fix the production path.
- Match test level to risk:
  - use unit tests for domain rules, parser behavior, state machines, focus policies, coordinators, and model logic
  - use UI tests/XCUITest for SwiftUI/UIKit lifecycle, keyboard behavior, navigation, accessibility, focus, sheet, and platform integration regressions
  - use integration or end-to-end tests when behavior crosses SSH/session/terminal rendering boundaries and can be exercised locally or in simulator
- Refactors must keep existing tests passing and should add coverage before simplifying risky or previously untested behavior.
- Keyboard and terminal input changes require focused regression coverage. At minimum, cover the relevant policy/model path in unit tests and the user-visible iOS behavior in XCUITest when software keyboard, accessory bar, hardware keyboard, IME/preedit, backspace repeat, find UI, floating controls, focus, or tab/view switching behavior is touched.
- Do not rely on "checked on my phone" or manual Xcode testing as the only validation for keyboard/input regressions. Keep simulator UI tests or unit tests that can be rerun by future agents.
- Before finishing non-documentation code changes, run the narrowest reliable build/test commands that exercise the touched behavior and report exactly what was run. If a test cannot run because of tooling or environment issues, report that as a residual risk.

## Commits

- Use **atomic commits**.
- Each commit must represent one coherent change that can be reviewed and reverted independently.
- Do not mix architecture docs, code moves, behavioral fixes, and unrelated cleanup in one commit unless they are inseparable.
- Prefer a sequence such as:
  - architecture/spec update
  - domain extraction
  - application/store extraction
  - infrastructure extraction
  - UI split
  - targeted safety fix
- Before committing, verify the diff matches a single intent.

## Key Components

### SSH
- **libssh2** + **OpenSSL** for SSH connections
- Auth methods: Password, SSH Key, Key+Passphrase
- Credentials stored in Keychain

### Data Sync
- **CloudKit** for server/workspace sync across devices
- Container: `iCloud.app.vivy.VivyTerm`
- Local fallback via UserDefaults

### Pro Tier (StoreKit 2)
- Free: 1 workspace, 1 server, 1 tab
- Pro: Unlimited everything
- Products: Monthly ($6.49), Yearly ($24.99), Lifetime ($49.99)

## Build Dependencies

### libghostty
Pre-built xcframework at `Vendor/libghostty/GhosttyKit.xcframework`
Build with: `./scripts/build.sh ghostty`

### libssh2 + OpenSSL
Build with: `./scripts/build.sh ssh`
Output: `Vendor/libssh2/{macos,ios,ios-simulator}/`

## Data Models

### Server
```swift
struct Server: Identifiable, Codable {
    let id: UUID
    var workspaceId: UUID
    var environment: ServerEnvironment
    var name: String
    var host: String
    var port: Int
    var username: String
    var authMethod: AuthMethod
    var keychainCredentialId: String
}
```

### Workspace
```swift
struct Workspace: Identifiable, Codable {
    let id: UUID
    var name: String
    var colorHex: String
    var environments: [ServerEnvironment]
    var order: Int
}
```

### ConnectionSession (local only, not synced)
```swift
struct ConnectionSession: Identifiable {
    let id: UUID
    let serverId: UUID
    var title: String
    var connectionState: ConnectionState
}
```

## UI Patterns

### macOS Layout
- NavigationSplitView with sidebar (workspaces/servers) and detail (terminal)
- Toolbar tabs for multiple connections
- `.windowToolbarStyle(.unified)`

### iOS Layout
- NavigationStack with server list
- Full-screen terminal with keyboard toolbar
- Sheet-based forms

### Liquid Glass (iOS 26+ / macOS 26+)
```swift
// Use adaptive helpers for backwards compatibility
.adaptiveGlass()           // Falls back to .ultraThinMaterial
.adaptiveGlassTint(.green) // For semantic tinting
```

## Important Notes

1. **Never apply glass to terminal content** - only navigation/toolbars
2. **Deduplicate by ID** when syncing from CloudKit
3. **Pro limits enforced in**: `ServerManager.canAddServer`, `canAddWorkspace`, `ConnectionSessionManager.canOpenNewTab`
4. **Keychain credentials** are NOT synced - only server metadata syncs via CloudKit
5. **iOS keyboard toolbar** provides Esc, Tab, Ctrl, arrows, function keys
6. **Voice-to-command** uses Apple Speech or optional Doubao ASR
